These are the LOG-MD Free Edition modules for ARTHIR.

They are broken down into one module per feature of LOG-MD.  Since ARTHIR runs modules 
from the modules.conf file, you can just select all the features you want and run them
as many or as few as needed.

ARTHIR has a TIME STARTED and TIME COMPLETED in the console output so you can determine 
which modules take the longest.  The general rule of thumb is the longer the module takes,
the lower in the modules.conf it is.

Each LOG-MD modules lists the MITRE ATT&CK Techniques that they cover.  Some are grouped into 
a special Technique Group ID to combine many Technique ID's into one grouping ID for ease of 
recording.
